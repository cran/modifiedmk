\description{
The empirical distribution of the Mann-Kendall test statistic is calculated by bootstrapped resampling.  The Hamed (2009) bias correction prewhitening technique can optionally be applied as the default for prewhitening before the bootstrapped Mann-Kendall test is applied (Lacombe et al., 2012).
}
\details{
Bootstrapped samples are calculated by resampling one value at a time from the time series with replacement.  The p-value (\eqn{p_s}) of the resampled data is estimated by (Yue and Pilon, 2004): \deqn{p_s = m_s/M} The Mann-Kendall test statistics (S) is calculated for each resampled dataset.  The resultant vector of resamples S statistics is then sorted in ascending ordering, where \eqn{p_s} is the rank corresponding the largest bootstrapped value of S being less than the test statistic value calculated from the actual data.  M is the total number of bootstrapped resamples.  The default value of M is 1000, however, Yue and Pilon (2004) suggest values between 1000 and 2000.
