\description{
Time series data is often influenced by serial-correlation. When data is not random and influenced by auto-correlation, Modified Mann-Kendall tests are to be used in trend detction. Hamed and Rao (1998) have proposed variance correction approach to address the issue of serial correlation in Trend analysis. Trend is removed from the series and effective sample size is calulated using significant serial correlation coefficients.
}
\details{
Trend free time series is constructed by calculating Sen's slope and Auto Correlation coefficient AR(1). Variance correction approach proposed by Hamed and Rao (1998) uses only significant values from all the available values of Auto-Correlation Coefficients. As suggested by Rao, A. R., Hamed, K. H., & Chen, H.-L. (2003), only first three Auto-Correlation coefficients are used.
