\title{Mann-Kendall Test of Prewhitened Time Series Data in Presence of Serial Correlation Using the von Storch (1995) Approach}
\usage{
pwmk(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- Time series data vector}
}
\value{
Z-Value  - Z statistic after prewhitening

Sen's Slope  - Sen's slope for prewhitened series

old. Sen's Slope  - Sen's slope for original data series (x)

P-value  - P-value after prewhitening

S  - Mann-Kendall S statistic

Var(s) - Variance of S

Tau  - Mann-Kendall's Tau
}
\description{
When time series data are not random and influenced by autocorrelation, preWhitening the time series prior to application of trend test is suggested.
}
\details{
The lag-1 serial correlation coefficient is used for prewhitening.

\examples{
x<-c(Nile)
